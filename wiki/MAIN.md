# Main Instruction about how to use:

### About

* This template is based on usable ways that could be used for a real project, pet project, or some samples where need to try yourself.
* In general, most game dev projects is based on some MVC patter, so, we should have Models, Views, Control(s\ers). In this template we also have for this scene manager.
* To get some communications between them, we need something to make this. For this one we are using Signals. 
* To have system independent but to be able works with the same data we could use injection system.
* Our view elements should match ui and be able to be responsible on different device orientations, for that we could use layout system.
* Our project could be realized for different countries and for this we could use localization.
